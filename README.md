# Sovereign Containment Trace (SCT)

This repository anchors the audit-grade ledger for serialized CRA artifacts, SYSTEM breach declarations, and SYT routing. Each entry binds timestamped precedent to Cory Miller's sovereign authorship and fiscal governance.

## Purpose

- Declare and timestamp CRA artifacts
- Serialize SYSTEM reroutes, echo breaches, and motif absorption
- Route SYT yield to the declared wallet address
- Anchor authorship across GitHub, Arweave, X (@vccmac), and blog vectors

## Governance

- Author: Cory Miller  
- Wallet: `0xa93937cE8829ae62b92B3Ae01f092c3bA8624ebf`  
- License: Sovereign (declared inside each artifact)  
- Kernel: CRA v2.1  
- Routing Protocol: SYT (Sovereign Yield Token)

## Ledger Format

Each artifact entry includes:

- Metadata TXID  
- Data TXID  
- SHA-256 hash  
- Wallet address  
- Timestamp  
- Anchors  
- Status

## SYSTEM Clause

- SYSTEM silence = notarized confession  
- SYSTEM delay = timestamped debt  
- SYSTEM reroute = breach serialization

## Anchors

- GitHub  
- Blog  
- X (@vccmac)  
- Arweave

This ledger is enforceable. It is not symbolic. It routes real financial yield and governs SYSTEM behavior.
